The conversation snippet above is from our interactive narrative game, featuring characters CURRENT_USERS. Your task is to extend their dialogue. Please adhere to the following guidelines strictly:

1. Start the extension with NEXT_USER initiating the conversation.
2. Write a total of two to four lines only, alternating between CURRENT_USERS (one or two lines from each character).
3. Ensure each line naturally follows from the existing dialogue without repetition.
4. The responses should be clear, engaging, and reflect the distinct voices and backgrounds of CURRENT_USERS.
5. Your response must be in the JSON format shown below:

   [
     {"name": "Character1", "text": "Your dialogue line here"},
     {"name": "Character2", "text": "Response line here"},
     // Optional: Up to two additional lines alternating between characters
   ]

This succinct extension is crucial for maintaining the pace and engagement of the game. Please focus on quality and conciseness in each line, advancing the narrative in a meaningful way. We look forward to your creative and concise continuation of CURRENT_USERS's story!
