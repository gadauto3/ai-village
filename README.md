# AI-Village
 Open-source prototype of an AI game build on AWS Lambda and using React

# Instructions
To start your game, click on "Add Conversation" to add more conversations; more chats means more points! Then click "Begin." As you read the villagers' chats, try to find the parts that the AI is making up. If you think it's happening, click the "I'm noticing AI generation" button. But be careful, you can only guess once per chat! An exactly right answer gives you 15 points. If you want to try again, just refresh the page to start over. Happy playing!
